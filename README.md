### What I learned

I basically learned how to work with Scalable Vector Graphic file formats (`SVG`)

- add them to a webpage with the `img` tag
- use them as a css `background-image`
- write them directly into the HTML document using the`<svg> </svg>` tag.
- And overall style `svg`'s file format to overwrite default behavior and adapt different properties to fit onto our webpage according to many design rules
